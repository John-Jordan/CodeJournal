Jotting down the happenings of my coding life.

8/9/21 - So I got off to a slow start but it was a start.  I'm starting back on The Odin Project to firm up my crumbling foundation on web development. I had some error in my VSCode editor that wouldn't let Intellisense autocomplete my code.  Simple stuff like typing div and it throwing all the correct syntax in there for me. I think it has something to do with a python thing i did a while back that i can't even remember what i did it for, but anyway, maybe i'll just keep using pycharm even though i'm not technically using python for the time being.  

8/10/21 - I'm gonna have to make more time to work on this or I'm gonna be 70 time I get this google home page created.  I got things set up with pycharm and linked my style sheet to it.  I linked to the google image and created the form input and two buttons under it.  I finally got them centered horizontally, though I already know I will have to change that up cause they can't all be linked in the same class like i tried. I'll tweak their positioning tomorrow and try to get the nav bar up and running.
