Jotting down the happenings of my coding life. 

9/27/21 - Busy times. Got started on my calculator app with the keys being operation symbols and the values being the name such as addition, subtraction, etc. 

9/22/21 - Started on Day 10. Learning about using the return statement and getting outputs from functions.  Will be making a calculator at the end. Classic.

9/18/21 - So I finished Day 9 but not without sratching my head a few dozen times.  Definitely had to go back and review the lesson a few times and look at how she set it up before it started to make sense to me. I know dictionaries make sense in a lot of situations but I much prefer lists if i can get away with it.

9/17/21 - I gotta stop waiting so late to get started on my coding. I rewatched the video on nesting dicionaries but then i about fell asleep so that's what i'm gonna do.  I'll have time tomorrow to spend some quality time with this Day and move on.

9/16/21 - Sometimes my brain just lets me down. I felt like I understood the intro to nesting dictionaries/lists and appending a dictionary to a list but then I start the new challenge and my brain fails me. I'll go back and watch the previous video tomorrow. Argh.

9/14/21 - Began Day 9 which deals with Dictionaries.  This wasn't my strongest area last time through so looking to solidify some logic this time.  I was able to complete the first challenge of looping through values in a dictionary and listing the keys with new values in a new dictionary.  Got it the first time so that is a win. Tomorrow we work on nested dictionaries which can cause brain strain, at least for me trying to keep it all straight.

9/12/21 - Completed Day 8 today.  I was able to write a small app that would encode and decode a message by shifting the characters to the left or right.  I built in contingencies for a user entering different symbols as well as inputting a large shift number. I feel pretty good about the logic of the programs i've created so far. 

9/11/21 - Worked on Day 8 some more today.  I built a prime number app to determine if a number is a prime number then started work on the main challenge problem of building a cipher.  I was able look up how to find the position of a list item and use it to shift each letter in a word the appropriate amount and print out the new word. Hope to finish my cipher tomorrow.

9/10/21 - Built an app that calculated the amount of paint cans required to paint a given wall and use the math roundup function. Defined a function with 3 inputs to use with it.  Worked. More time tomarrow to make progress.

9/8/21 - Last night I was helping my daughter with geometry and it sounded a lot like coding. We were working with conditional statements and reformatting sentences and such.  Tonight I moved onto Day 8 which will end with a Cipher program.  I listened to several videos about using functions with inputs and the difference in parameters and arguments. I would have kept going but I felt my head nodding off so I quit before I stopped retaining info.  

9/6/21 - This evening I finished the Day 7 challenge of writing a hangman game.  I added the ascii art and finished adding logic for when I get a letter wrong.  It now shows the correct ascii art for missing a letter and informs the user of their mistake. Looks pretty good if i do say so.  And even better, i understood how it all works. 

9/4/21 - I set up a while loop so I can keep asking for the next letter guess. Worked a little on checking for wrong answers. Don't think I'm putting the decrementing code in the right spot.  If I enter a wrong letter it says "you lose." immediately instead of having 6 lives.  I'll check on that next time.  

9/3/21 - I didn't really accomplish much today beyond looking at my code and trying to figure out why my code was not replacing the dash with the guessed letter. I'm screwing something up in my for loop. I'm able to print out the numeric positions of each letter in the word but not yet able to replace that number with the guessed letter.  Maybe I can squeeze some more brain time in tomorrow amidst all the football.
Addendum #1 - So I was using a == to assign the new letter to the position in the list instead of a single =.  So nothing was changing.  Doh.  Moving on to the next part tomorrow.

9/1/21 - The challenge for day 7 was to make a hangman game.  I got the dashes set up in my list ok, and ran through the letters but I have an issue with it replacing my guessed letters with the correct letter.  The dashes stay there.  I'll debug it tomorrow.

8/31/21 - Finished up Day 6 today.  It threw in a few more Reeborg World challenges including a maze that I had to use while loops and if/elif/else statements to get my robot to the goal location.  Not too troublesome.

8/29/21 - Worked on Day 6 today. It introduced writing functions and using the While loop.  It primarily used a website called Reeborg's World to program a robot to move around a board.  I wrote functions to compile movement directions for the robot into one line of code.  I also used while loops to allow the code to continue running under certain paramaters.  I should write and complete the final challenge for day 6 tomorrow.

8/28/21 - So i did find the function I was looking for.  I was able to use the shuffle function to mix up the items in my password list I had made.  I then used a for loop to go through the password list and add each character to an empty string which when completed, all I had to do was print the string out.  So Day 5 is completed and its on to day 6.

8/26/21 - Another late start but I got the easy version of the password generator completed. Now I just need to figure out how to mix them all up  instead of spitting them out in order.  I'm sure there is a function that will do that for me.  I'll look it up tomorrow and be done with day 5.

8/25/21 - I continued with day 5, completing the adding even numbers only using a loop and the range function.  I then completed a fizzbuzz challenge easy enough which was supposed to be a common interview challenge.  I wouldn't be so lucky as to get that challenge.  I read the rules on the password generator final challenge but didn't start it cuz its late and I should have started sooner. Getting the input for the number of letters, numbers and symbols sounds easy enough, will have to think about how to get them all jumbled up randomly. I'll sleep on it.

8/24/21 - So I continued on with day 5 and completed a couple more challenges.  I made the average height calculator and then completed the highest score in a list challenge.  It didn't allow us to use shortcuts like max(), min(), or sum().  Instead, they wanted me to utilize loops to gain a better understanding of how they work. This was a bit easier to review and I had minimal cobwebs to complete these projects.  Pushing on.

8/23/21 - I finished my rock, paper, scissors program.  Mine was slightly longer than Angela's but it worked. I proceeded to start on Day 5 - Loops.  Started the lessons and building an average height calculator.

8/21/21 - Worked on a problem that utilized nested lists and replaced data with a new value.  Also started working on coding the rock, paper, scissors game.  I thought I had worked on that the other day but it was a different one. This will be the last project for day 4.

8/19/21 - I built a small program to decide who pays the check after a meal.  It used the random module to pick out a name that I had added to a list from user input.  Took a couple tries to get the syntax correct but it works. I even through a for loop in at the end to make it run through it 10 times and see how random it was.  Looked good to me.  I'll prob erase it and make a couple more just to let it sink in.  

8/18/21 - So I had to go back pretty far to refresh some things I used to remember no prop (see what happens when you wander off too long).  I reviewed the random module and if/else statements and coded a coin flip and paper,rock,scissors game.  I then started in on lists and appending to them.  I'll keep going with it tomorrow, prob remind myself what the for loops look like and hope to iterate through lists.  Reviewing, a necessary step when you stop for too long.

8/17/21 - I had planned on checking out C# some more but I have been persuaded to put that aside and focus on Python once again.  I have a tendency to want to play in the shallow end of the progamming pool cuz its all fun and games and nothing too traumatizing to my fragile brain. So I will once again start on my 100 days of Python course with the intent of finishing it in however many days it takes.  It may mean it is 1000 days of Python if that is the pace I need to get things to stick in my head. So I'll be starting back further than I left off because I had already drifted into the nether with my understanding and pushing forward when you don't understand something is a recipe for, well, hopping back in the shallow end.   I've listened to a few of the video lessons today and will decide where I need to resume.

8/16/21 - So I was struggling with wanting to do any coding today cuz I new I was returning to my old friend CSS and it i'm stumped.  Think I'm just gonna have to wait until I'm able to go to some in person coding meetups and have someone who can sort my CSS brain out.  With covid making a comeback it could be a bit longer.  That said, I figure I'd just do something interesting and learn something new.  I'm always down to learn something new so that was an easy way to get some coding done in some form.  I jumped onto the Microsoft Learn website and started a learning module on C#.  Its beginner stuff so just learning some of the syntax and such but it will go fairly quick since I've played in the shallow water in a a couple other languages already.  Who knows, maybe I'll get into the whole .NET stuff.

8/14/21 - Tweaked some things and tried to get it centered vertically and it screwed everything up. So I put it back.  That is all.

8/13/21 - I got the google logo and search bar/buttons centered horizontally on the screen.  I had to tinker with the width of the elements for some reason.  Next task is centering them vertically.   I also floated over a couple of my nav bar items to the right side on the top nav bar.  So its slowly coming together.

8/12/21 - Lamest entry yet, i know, 4 days but still.  Got the buttons to move to the center, kinda.  They stayed inline and stopped hopping on top of eachother but everything is still slightly off to the right. Something funky going on with my centering. I'm gonna have to go read some more tomorrow.  I'll try to keep the lame coding sessions to a minimum going forward.

8/11/21 - Busy day so didn't get to work as much as i needed but I got the navbar started.  It's horizontal and its at the top.  Got a few words spaced out. Still need to split them up and get a couple on the right side which shouldn't be too much trouble.  Still struggling with getting the google image and search bar positioned correctly along with the buttons. Probably mixing up inline and block elements and trying to move them the wrong way. It does feel less stressful doing a little bit each day as long as i learn something and make progress.  I think i put too much pressure on myself to learn faster and master things more quickly. I'm guessing that as i actually retain stuff i'll want to spend more time building cuz its less frustrating.

8/10/21 - I'm gonna have to make more time to work on this or I'm gonna be 70 time I get this google home page created.  I got things set up with pycharm and linked my style sheet to it.  I linked to the google image and created the form input and two buttons under it.  I finally got them centered horizontally, though I already know I will have to change that up cause they can't all be linked in the same class like i tried. I'll tweak their positioning tomorrow and try to get the nav bar up and running.

8/9/21 - So I got off to a slow start but it was a start.  I'm starting back on The Odin Project to firm up my crumbling foundation on web development. I had some error in my VSCode editor that wouldn't let Intellisense autocomplete my code.  Simple stuff like typing div and it throwing all the correct syntax in there for me. I think it has something to do with a python thing i did a while back that i can't even remember what i did it for, but anyway, maybe i'll just keep using pycharm even though i'm not technically using python for the time being.
