Jotting down the happenings of my coding life.

8/9/21 - So I got off to a slow start but it was a start.  I'm starting back on The Odin Project to firm up my crumbling foundation on web development. I had some error in my VSCode editor that wouldn't let Intellisense autocomplete my code.  Simple stuff like typing div and it throwing all the correct syntax in there for me. I think it has something to do with a python thing i did a while back that i can't even remember what i did it for, but anyway, maybe i'll just keep using pycharm even though i'm not technically using python for the time being.
